# Description 
I made a simple snake game, where the goal is for the snake to collect as much food as possible. When he hits any matrix wall or himself, the game ends, displaying a "GAME OVER" message. It will be displayed immediately after the position in which he died, after which you can start a new game by pressing the joystick.
